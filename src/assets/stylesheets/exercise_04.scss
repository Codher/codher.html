// This is the big one - Time to style an article with a lot of content
// Take a look at http://localhost:8181/article.html and try to recreate the look
// You can find the solution in _articles.scss, but we don't recommend you going
// there until you've planned
//
// NB: There are many properties of css we haven't explored together today, you
// can always visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
// to find what other things you can change on a website.
